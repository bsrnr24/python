#HOMEWORK-1#
I used pyautogui, webbrowser and time modules in my homework. With the Webbrowser module, I enabled it to open the website using the browser installed on the computer. I took a screenshot from the page I opened with the pyautogui module. With the Time module, I determined after how many seconds the page will be closed.
