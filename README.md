#HOMEWORK-1#
I used pyautogui, webbrowser and time modules in my homework. With the Webbrowser module, I enabled it to open the website using the browser installed on the computer. I took a screenshot from the page I opened with the pyautogui module. With the Time module, I determined after how many seconds the page will be closed.

#HOMEWORK-3#
I used requests, BeautifulSoup and tkinter modules for the assignment. With the Requests module, I carried out the transactions and requests on the web, and provided the address with the https extension. With the BeautifulSoup module, I provided access to the original locations in the html file. I created a separate tkinter page with the tkinter module and printed the data I received on that page. Finally, except for the tkinter page, when I run the code, I get the data in the form of a list.
