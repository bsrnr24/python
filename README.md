_I used pyautogui, webbrowser and time modules in my homework. With the Webbrowser module, I enabled it to open the website using the browser installed on the computer. I took a screenshot from the page I opened with the pyautogui module. With the Time module, I determined after how many seconds the page will be closed._

_I used tkinter and selenium modules in my homework. I used the Selenium module with the help of webdriver. I tried to open the account on Instagram according to the username with Webdriver. Thanks to Selenium, I got the follower count data of the account. Then I created the tkinter page. On this page I created, I printed the follower count data I received._

_I used requests, BeautifulSoup and tkinter modules for the assignment. With the Requests module, I carried out the transactions and requests on the web, and provided the address with the https extension. With the BeautifulSoup module, I provided access to the original locations in the html file. I created a separate tkinter page with the tkinter module and printed the data I received on that page. Finally, except for the tkinter page, when I run the code, I get the data in the form of a list._
